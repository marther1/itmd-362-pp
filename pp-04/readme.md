# Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android/Google, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).
Focus on touch-related elements.

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Android:
  https://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/user-interaction/authentication/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: I delayed the login/sign-in as long as possible. The user are first allowed to browse the app and are only required to login when necessary (for ex. viewing iit calendar doesn't require login but Academics requires the user to sign in to view their personal data).

* HCI Guideline Two (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/themes/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: By using Consistency design principles the user is greeted with a familiar looking login screen, where the screen has known icons, standard text styles and most importantly, the app contains feature and behaviors in the way people expect.

* HCI Guideline Three (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/bars/search-bars/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: I implemented a search bar because if the user can't find what they are looking for they can just search it by typing inside the search bar.
