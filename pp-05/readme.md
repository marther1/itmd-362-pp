# Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists each containing at least 25 items (use Google,
but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own,
condensed list of exactly ten items.

Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create
your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you've found:

1. http://drpete.co/?topic=25-point-website-usability-checklist
2. https://stayintech.com/UX

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1. Accessible navigation. Site can be navigated with a keyboard, without using a mouse. Browser's keyboard shortcuts aren't overridden.
2. Links, buttons and checkboxes are easily clickable, for example a user can select a checkbox by clicking the text, not just the checkbox.
3. Color. Visited link color is different than unvisited.
4. Site is responsive. Works with different screen sizes. There is no horizontal scrolling.
5. Simplicity. Only absolutely necessary questions are asked in forms.
6. Form submission is confirmed, so that the user knows data was successfully sent.
7. Font Size/Spacing Is Easy to Read
8. Styles & Colors Are Consistent
9. Links are descriptive. There are no "click here" links.
10. Error messages are shown next to the input field, not just on top of the page.
