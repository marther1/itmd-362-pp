1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

+ Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=14e0u0klullw0bse+b34uqIsGG7
+ Your Rationale: I Chose the color purple because it's a royalty color it stands above all the other consoles in the market, also gives a luxury and powerful feeling.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

+ Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=52m0u0klHozs1gEh0ia1MsnH7xU
+ Your Rationale: I chose the green, lime green and yellow as they are the colors that come to mind when thinking of spring time, also these colors when seen together gives a relaxation feeling and would be perfect for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

+ Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=31T121k-wzVOmc8o+kt9PrFDsr+kDhpQTO9a8Rb9hGfKT3eMkxzsLuxiVj6A4hyeU+zeC
+ Your Rationale: I chose the bright colors red, yellow, and green as they're used to them. Kids see the bright colors everyday in their lives and can't tell much difference between the shades of the colors, as most of them only know/notice very few colors.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

+ Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=c4H3M135D1kL600SR00K+00+900Wn00k++mW+O46PE7deSaJ+sfrk0V++TO9a8DnXhGfKT3eMk++kx+Ldm+L-ZWDiLUS8a
+ Your Rationale: The 4 colors that come to mind when I see the word cybersecurity are: dark red, dark blue, white and black. I see white as the background color with black text and dark red headings, and dark blue color used in the images and logos.
